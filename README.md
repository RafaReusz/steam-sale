### Features
- [x] Buying products;
- [ ] Selling products;
- [ ] Checking the supply and demand of the product.

### Requirements
Before starting, you need to install: [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/), [Selenium](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/installation.html) and [Chrome Driver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads). <br />
Furthermore, I recommend you a code editor. My suggestion: [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/).

### Objectives
At the first moment, I noticed that the prices of many products in the steam community market have a pattern. I was first looking for items which had high liquidity, however most part of them did not have a margin bigger than 10% (which is not worth, because the fees are 15% if you do not know.). Then, I started looking for "forgotten products" or low liquidity items, and I found out: you can buy at a low price (55%; 50%; even R$0.03) and sell for the full price! The algorithm detects which price will be the output, depending how the offers are distributed, and that is it, your offer is ready! When somebody sells for the respective price you will buy it, and you will be able to sell the product(s) after 7 days (because of the Steam Guard system), then you sell for the cost that judge fair!
